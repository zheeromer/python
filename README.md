# Failed Login Detection Script

## Overview
This project demonstrates a simple Python script that analyses authentication log data to identify repeated failed login attempts.

## Purpose
The script simulates a basic security monitoring task by highlighting IP addresses that exceed a defined threshold of failed login attempts.

## Technologies
- Python
- Basic log analysis concepts

## How It Works
- Reads authentication log entries from a file
- Counts failed login attempts per IP address
- Flags IPs exceeding a configurable threshold

## Security Relevance
This type of automation can support security operations by helping identify potential brute-force or suspicious login activity for further investigation.
